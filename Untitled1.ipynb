In this case, it tracks the total number of increments made by all instances.Access: Can be accessed using Counter.count or any instance (instance.count), but modifying it affects all instances.self._count (Instance Variable):Scope: Specific to the individual instance.Purpose: Keeps track of a value unique to that instance. In this case, it tracks the number of increments made to that particular instance.Access: Accessed using self within instance methods.\n",

This reflects the count of increments specific to that instance.Class Variable (Counter.count):**Effect**: Also increases by 1 each time the increment method is called on any instance. This reflects the total number of increments across all instances.while **Counter.count** tracks the total number of increments across all instances.The increment method modifies both variables, demonstrating how instance and class variables interact in Python classes"
